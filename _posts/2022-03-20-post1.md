# Collecting data on the BRI

What may seem like a trivial task, identifying when a country has joined a massive international infrasturcture project should be rather straight forward. This was also our assumption when we embarked on this project. A few months later we are somewhat wiser. There are various pitfalls in the data-collection, ranging from uncertainty over the specific date, or the document. Some treaties were later included in the broader BRI framework, sometimes countries have held official high-level meeting to sign a so-called 'Memorandum of Understanding'.
