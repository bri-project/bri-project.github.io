## Novel global data on BRI membership

We collected data on the BRI membership status of all sovereign states in the international system including island states and micro-states (N=249). We measure BRI membership with signatures of Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and other cooperation agreements with China, which express a state's willingness to participate in the BRI. We coded for each sovereign state whether it has signed a bilateral agreement with China in the context of the BRI and when the bilateral agreement was signed (on a monthly level). If a state has signed multiple bilateral BRI agreements with China, we code the date of the first agreement. Given that only a few of these agreements are publicly available, we rely on secondary sources such as newspaper articles, policy briefs, and academic publications to identify whether a state became a member of the BRI. We coded a state only as a BRI member if we have traced at least one piece of evidence that explicitly states that a given state has signed a bilateral BRI agreement with China. The sources for our coding decisions can be obtained upon request from the authors of this project. 

While we studied an extensive amount of sources to identify the BRI membership status of each state, it is possible that we were unable to identify some BRI agreements. Consequently, we might under-count the actual number of member states in the BRI. Further, it is possible that we were unable to identify the first BRI agreement of a given state, resulting in lagged reporting of the date of entry. We seek to minimize these biases by relying on the insights of country experts and other BRI specialists. If you spot a mistake in the data presented below, we would appreciate to receive your suggestion of improvement. Please contact us with your suggestion via email (bri-china[at]gmx.de), ideally with a piece of evidence supporting your correction. We carefully consider each suggestion of improvement and revise the data accordingly if the correction is supported by credible evidence. We believe that this crowd-sourcing of BRI expertise in combination with our careful validation procedure will further increase the accuracy of our global BRI membership data.
