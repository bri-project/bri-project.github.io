What may seem like a trivial task, identifying when a country has joined a massive international infrasturcture project, turned out to be everything but straight forward.

# Collecting data on the BRI

## The data collection process

Our assumption when we embarked on this project was that there would certainly exist a comprehensive collection of dates when a country joined the Beld and Road Initiative. A few months later we are somewhat wiser. There are various pitfalls in the data-collection, ranging from uncertainty over the specific date, or the document. Some treaties were later included in the broader BRI framework, sometimes countries have held official high-level meeting to sign a so-called 'Memorandum of Understanding'.
